# Iteration 0 – Baseline Kubernetes the Hard Way

This iteration represents a raw setup, mostly manual Kubernetes setup inspired by
Kubernetes the Hard Way.

## Goals
- Understand the architecture. How do components communicate? You probably know this conceptually, but what is technically required?
- Go through the pain. Sounds harsh but when I encounter stuff where I think like "Is this really necessary?", only then you would realize why add-ons exists and what they solve
- Avoid add-ons and abstractions. I did write some scripts. But I tried to keep in minimal
